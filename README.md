## How It Works

GitHub automatically uses files from this `.github` repository as defaults for all repositories in the UPENN-PNGC organization. Individual repositories can override these defaults by including their own versions of these files.

## Customization

To customize these files for a specific repository:

1. Copy the desired file(s) from this repository
2. Place them in the target repository at the same relative path
3. Modify as needed for that repository's specific requirements

## Maintenance

These files should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure they remain relevant and useful for all organization repositories.
